## Folder Structure

- **data**: Contains the data from the LLM-Redial dataset. It includes the following folders: Books, Electronics, Movies, and Sports. Each folder contains:
  - `Conversation.txt`
  - `final_data.jsonl`
  - `item_map.json`
  - `user_ids.json`
  
  Note: Each user must manually move these files into this folder since the repository will not include them due to their size.

- **models**: This folder contains the scripts for the models. It should include the executables and classes defined for each model that we will build.

- **notebooks**: This folder is exclusively for notebooks used in the development and analysis process.

- **scripts**: This folder contains general-purpose scripts such as those for plotting and data handling.
